                <p><i>AGING</i> journal publishes high-impact research papers of general
                interest and biological significance in all fields of aging research including
                but not limited to cellular senescence, organismal aging, age-related diseases, DNA damage response and repair,
                genetic control of aging from yeast to mammals, regulation of longevity,
                evolution of aging, anti-aging strategies and drug development and especially
                the role of signal transduction pathways in aging and potential approaches to
                modulate these signaling pathways to extend lifespan. </p>

                <p>The basic criterion for considering papers is their impact on aging research. </p>

                <p>In addition to primary research articles in three formats (Priority Reports, Research Articles, Theory Articles),
                <i>AGING</i> publishes Reviews, Mini-reviews, Perspectives, Commentaries and Letters to the Editor.
                </p>

                <p>All submissions are initially evaluated in depth by the editors. Papers that
                do not conform to the general criteria for publication will be returned to the
                authors without detailed review, typically within 2-4 days. Otherwise, manuscripts will be sent to 2-3 reviewers who
                have agreed in advance to assess the paper rapidly. The editors will make every effort to reach decisions on these
                papers within 3 weeks of the submission date. If revisions are a condition of publication, we generally allow 3 months
                for revisions and consider only one revised version of the paper.

                    The use of standardized nomenclature in all fields of science and medicine is an essential step toward the
                    integration and linking of scientific information reported in published literature. We will enforce the
                    use of correct and established nomenclature wherever possible: We strongly encourage the use of SI units.
                    If you do not use these exclusively, please provide the SI value in parentheses after each value. Species
                    names should be italicized (e.g., <i>Homo sapiens</i>) and the full genus and species must be written out
                    in full, both in the title of the manuscript and at the first mention of an organism in a paper; after
                    that, the first letter of the genus name, followed by the full species name may be used. Genes, mutations,
                    genotypes, and alleles should be indicated in italics. Use the recommended name by consulting the
                    appropriate genetic nomenclature database, e.g., HUGO. It is sometimes advisable to indicate the synonyms
                    for the gene the first time it appears in the text. Gene prefixes such as those used for oncogenes or
                    cellular localization should be shown in roman: v-fes, c-MYC, etc.
